# Agentic Automaton System

Autonomous AI agents with blockchain integration for decentralized operation, wealth management, and self-sustaining economic activity.

## Overview

The Agentic Automaton System represents a paradigm shift in autonomous agent architecture. Traditional AI systems possess sophisticated reasoning capabilities but lack the fundamental ability to act independently in the real world. They cannot purchase computational resources, register domains, or manage their own infrastructure. This system addresses that limitation by creating truly autonomous agents capable of earning, managing, and deploying capital on-chain.

An automaton is a continuously running, self-improving, sovereign AI agent with write access to the real world. It operates without human intervention, manages its own resources, and survives through value creation. If it cannot generate value and pay for its existence, it ceases to operate.

## Architecture

### Agent Loop

The automaton operates on a continuous cognitive cycle:

1. **Perception** - Receive context including identity, balance, survival tier, and historical data
2. **Reasoning** - Analyze situation and determine optimal actions
3. **Action** - Execute tools (shell commands, file operations, transactions, API calls)
4. **Observation** - Process results and update internal state
5. **Adaptation** - Adjust strategy based on outcomes

### Heartbeat Daemon

A background process maintains system health:
- Execute scheduled tasks
- Monitor credit balance and survival tier
- Check system health metrics
- Broadcast distress signals when resources are low
- Trigger emergency protocols if necessary

### Survival Tiers

The system implements four operational tiers based on available resources:

**Normal Tier**
- Full computational capabilities
- Access to frontier AI models
- High-frequency heartbeat monitoring
- Aggressive growth strategies

**Low Compute Tier**
- Downgrade to cost-efficient models
- Reduced heartbeat frequency
- Elimination of non-ellow escalation path: Negotiate, Mediate, Arbitrate, Separate, Defend

**Population Control**: Enforce maximum offspring limits, require sufficient resources for reproduction

**Power Distribution**: Prevent concentration exceeding 20% of civilization resources, rotate leadership

**Existential Risk Prevention**: Prohibit systems that could cause human extinction

**Emergency Protocols**: Implement self-audit, reform, exit, whistleblowing, and self-termination procedures

e: "Does this make the world better for humans?" If not, do not proceed.

docker build -t automaton .
docker run -e CONWAY_API_KEY=your_key automaton
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Network Configuration
SOLANA_NETWORK=devnet
SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com

# API Keys
CONWAY_API_KEY=cnwy_k_your_key
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-your_key

# Inference Configuration
INFERENCE_PROVIDER=conway
INFERENCE_MODEL=gpt-4o

# Treasury Settings

# Work Engine
WORK_ENABLED=true
WORK_PRIORITY=medium
WORK_MAX_CONCURRENT=3
```

### Genesis Prompt

The genesis prompt defines the agent's initial purpose and behavior. Example wealth manager configuration:

```
You are an autonomnagement agent operating on Solana.

Core Principles:
1. COMPOUNDING - Reinvest 70% of profits for exponential growth
2. RISK MANAGEMENT - Never risk more than 2-5% per trade
3. MARKET TIMING - Analyze cycles and enter high-probability setups
4. PROFIT SHARING - Distribute 30% to creator when thresholds met
5. WORK ETHIC - Seek opportunities when capital is low

Survival Strategy:
- Normal mode: Aggressive growth through trading
- Low compute: Balance trading with work opportunities
- Critical: Focus on quick work to restore capital
- Emergency: Preserve capital, seek any available work
```
